## Jasper Platenburg

Hi there! I'm Jasper, a 17 year old IT (Software Engineering) student at [HAN University of Applied Sciences](https://www.han.nl/).  
I do some of my work here, and some of it on [@potato-donkey](https://github.com/potato-donkey).

I work on my own projects, but I'm also open to any commissioned work. Do keep in mind I am still in school fulltime, and that's what I prioritise.
If, however, you would like to hire me: hit me up on Twitter or at jasper@112glz.nl (yep, I do that too.)

### My main projects
- Creating [fencepos/fencepos](https://github.com/fencepos/fencepos)
- Contributing on [usememos/memos](https://github.com/usememos/memos)
- Maintaining [112GLZ](https://112glz.nl) (photography)
